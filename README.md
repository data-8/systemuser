# systemuser
Customized docker image spawned by JupyterHub.

This docker image is based on [jupyterhub/systemuser](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/tree/master/systemuser). Our customizations are tailored to the needs of the UC Berkeley course [DS8](http://data8.org) and its connected courses in the [Data Science Education Program](http://databears.berkeley.edu).
